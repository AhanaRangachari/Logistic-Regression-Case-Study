# Logistic-Regression-Case-Study
Lead scoring case study using logistic regression

Problem statement - to create a logistic regression model for an online education company. The goal is to help them improve conversion rate for their online courses. Currently they contact all their possible leads and acheive a low conversion of only 30%. By identifying the leads most likely to convert, the company can optimise their resources.

Steps followed:
- Data exploration
- Data cleaning
- Data preparation
- Model building using RFE
- Model evaluation
- Making predictions on test data

With this, we were able to create a model that assigned a score to each lead indicating liklihood of conversion and also predicted if the lead would convert or not. Using this, the company could increase their conversion rate to 80%
